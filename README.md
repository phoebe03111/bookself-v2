BookSelf is a user-friendly web application designed to assist users in curating a virtual bookshelf and effectively monitoring their reading progress.

With BookSelf, people can easily stay organized by categorizing their books into three distinct sections: "Finished Reading," "Currently Reading," and "To-Read List." Moreover, users can set personalized reading goals, allowing them to establish targets and track their progress over time.
